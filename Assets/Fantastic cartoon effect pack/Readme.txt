Pack includes 12 effect prefabs. 

NOTE:

For correct work as in demo scene you need enable "HDR" on main camera and add CC.asset(post processing profile)
with help of Post Processing behaviour script.

Using effects:
Just drag and drop prefab of effect on scene and use that :)
In play mode: Drag the object to the folder with the desired color. Sometimes it will be necessary to change the color of the material.
